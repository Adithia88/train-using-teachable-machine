The repository includes:
* Using teachable machine learning for image classification 
* Evaluation (confussion matrix) 
* Deploy it to Mobile phone 


# Getting Started
Download this repo and dataset too, if u want use this dataset
* start from making image classification models using teachable machine learning 
* deploy on mobile phone

additional info :
teachable machine is algorithm to make model easy based on web ( https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image )
